      "message": "Thanks!\n\nI could have mentioned in the commit message this is part of a larger set of changes to remove SerialDeletePtr from the platform API in place of just using std::unique_ptr with a custom deleter where we need to pass objects out with async deletion.\n\nThis was one of the couple of places where we hand out a SerialDeletePtr so instead of changing it, just moving it to util/ makes more sense.",
