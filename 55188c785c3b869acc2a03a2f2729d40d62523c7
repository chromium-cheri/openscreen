      "message": "Seeing this duplicated throughout all these build files makes me wonder if this should be default configuration, and not have to explicitly add it to every source_set.\n\nIn other words, maybe it should be default config, and then make sure the few targets that are not built for Chromium (e.g., platform/impl targets) are just guarded by \"if (!build_with_chromium)\".\n\nWebRTC does this by setting the include dirs in its root BUILD.gn file: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/webrtc/BUILD.gn?rcl\u003d8846c8af8511b505c4b61cefd4db49d15871baa7\u0026l\u003d139 Seems like that would work well for OpenScreen as well.\n\nThoughts?",
