      "message": "It\u0027s been on by default since November, via build/config/features.h. ðŸ˜Š There\u0027s a TODO in that file for me to add a BUILD.gn target that auto-generates that header based on GN args (same approach as Chromium).\n\nThe header file is needed to ensure that the ENABLE_TRACE_LOGGING macro is consistently present/not-present when compiling ANY file in repo. While BUILD.gn has defines\u003d[...], using that does not guarantee the macro will be present in all build targets. Therefore, some .h or .cc files that #include \"util/trace_logging.h\" will evaluate the header with it defined, but others would evaluate it NOT defined; and this can lead to big problems at link time.\n\nAlso, discussed in a recent CL: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/openscreen/+/2036580/2/cast/standalone_receiver/main.cc#162",
