      "message": "Thanks for the feedback. I cleaned this up in the latest patchset. For Chromium builds, `have_libsdl2` and `have_ffmpeg` are false, so we would not build with SDL.\n\nI flattened the conditional so it is just checking `build_receiver_with_sdl`. Doing this keeps the `cast_receiver` source set dependency logic simple.",
