      "message": "Looking at the API here and considering previous comments about sharing the underlying QUIC connection, is the expectation that there is always an existing ScreenConnection for a given receiver (advertised via OnConnectionAdded) even without any Presentation API calls being made?  So ScreenConnectionClient::Start() just opens QUIC connections to every discovered device?",

Plus, it would require the whole JPAKE password thing in many cases.\n\nI was thing it\u0027s more like an \"on demand\" thing.  When you need to, you create one.  The first time, you might also need to be prepared to put in a JPAKE password.  Future times, you could do it ahead of time if you anticipated an action and wanted more speed (say... there\u0027s only 1 device in the list and you expect the user will click on it).  \n\nBut we shouldn\u0027t consider setting up a connection so cheap as to make them like crazy.",

      "message": "Looking at the server patch, this needs a base because only the server can suspend, and they have different error and metrics types (which actually hold the same data).  Although it probably makes less sense to suspend the connection client, is there any reason we couldn\u0027t?  I suppose it\u0027s not really a problem, but the client and server seem so similar, I wonder if they could just be the same type (ScreenConnectionEndpoint?), with something like a \"should_listen\" flag.  For that matter, I suppose that could just be how they are implemented, even though the interfaces are separate.  It feels hard to say without any implementation above _or_ below.",
