You\u0027re the first user\nPreviously me/Mark/Brandon thought that this didn\u0027t seem quite worth it - but that was before the OnInstanceClaimed callback was added (Which often won\u0027t be needed by embedders). Also, I feel like, even if its a simple layer, it would make everything more readable/usable since embedders don\u0027t need to understand that DnsSdInstanceRecord class",
