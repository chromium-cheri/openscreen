I made it a fatal error just to preserve the existing behavior, where `length !\u003d 1` was an error.\n\n`ASN1_INTEGER_get_int64` would allow negative values and we specifically want to reject those. Negative `pathlen` values are a syntax error:\n\n```\n   BasicConstraints ::\u003d SEQUENCE {\n        cA                      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,\n        pathLenConstraint       INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL }\n```\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280\n\nIt also wouldn\u0027t have done anything about overflow since `int64_t` may not fit in `int`.\n\n(BoringSSL\u0027s parser should just reject that, but we\u0027re not there yet for... reasons.)\n\n\u003e If that\u0027s not true then you probably should add something from base/numerics/safe_conversions.h here.\n\nDoes safe_conversions.h exist in openscreen?
