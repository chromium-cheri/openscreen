      "message": "In the parsed structure, we\u0027re using a double. However, the JSON should still be a string the spec describes (a rational). Converting the double to a rational is a bit of code, with all kinds of corner cases. I\u0027m thinking maybe we should split the frame_rate member of Dimension into two ints: frame_rate_numerator and frame_rate_denominator, and then the string formatting of that is trivial. WDYT?",
