      "message": "I tried to come up with a way to stop repeating this code so often\n\nMoving the MdnsMessage creation IMHO makes the code less readable (I use a few different flavors of this call throughout this file and this hides those details)\n\nIt turns out it can eliminate a few lines to add a method AddRecordsOfTypes(DnsType::kA, DnsType::kAAAA, etc....), but this only saved a couple lines and I found it decreased readability over having the code be more explicit (AddRecordsOfTypes needs to use template magic, so it\u0027s not the most readable), especially in cases where I don\u0027t use the boilerplate GetFake\u003ctype\u003eRecord methods.\nIMHO it\u0027s not worth it to save 1-3 lines per method, but open to changing. WDYT?",
