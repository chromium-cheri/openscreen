They were already written + tested before we decided against including them in the NetworkRunner layer, so I wanted to check everyone\u0027s thoughts before pulling this out.\n\nIn the current setup, these methods are written here but not exposed in NetworkRunner, so callers cannot access them. For this reason I see it as reasonable to not delete the existing code. Especially since we\u0027ve already decided it needs to be removed and hasn\u0027t been yet\n\nThoughts @pthatcher @mfoltz",
