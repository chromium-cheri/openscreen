      "message": "I tested this by adding a print statement to see how many times it gets called during a build, and the answer is only one time.\n\nI was looking at adding it as a build step, we do have the ability to declare an action in a BUILD.gn, however it requires that you output something into your output directory. Looking at taking a more complicated approach here doesn\u0027t seem to help. We can touch base tomorrow, if we like the other approach more I\"m happy to prep a second patch.",
