      "message": "1. Might be worth testing that each member of |Types| is DnsType (since I don\u0027t think `DnsType...` is a thing), unless `types_{types...}` provides sufficient type checking + error messages.\n2. It looks like you only added construct+write support here.  If we needed to read one there would need to be something like a std::vector/absl::Span constructor, right?  I\u0027m not previously familiar with its use in mDNS but above you say it\u0027s for negative responses.  Wouldn\u0027t we also care about reading this from other responders?",
