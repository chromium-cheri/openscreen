# libcast

libcast is an open source implementation of the Cast protocols that allow Cast
senders to launch Cast applications and stream real-time media to
Cast-compatible devices (aka "receivers").

Submodules include:

  * [cast/streaming](streaming/README.md) - Cast Streaming (sender and receiver)
  * [receiver/public](receiver/public/README.md) - Cast server socket and a demonstration
    server (agent).
  * [sender/public](sender/public/README.md) - Cast client socket and supporting APIs to
    launch Cast applications.
