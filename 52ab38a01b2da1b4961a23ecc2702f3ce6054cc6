My reasoning for adding it:\n1) Elsewhere in this CL, we are required to wrap our TaskRunner as a Chromium TaskRunner again (Chromium QUIC requires it), and this method is exposed for that purpose. See osp/impl/quic/quic_connection_factory_impl.cc for more details.\n2) In the new iteration of Part 1, We allow the embedder to inject in a Task Runner of their choice into the Network Runner. Since we do not know the type of Task Runner any longer, we cannot make such assumptions here and need to be able to initialize the Task Runner without that information (if initialization is needed). I\u0027ve added this method as a requirement to allow for such initialization\n\nI am happy to make the change as long as these issues are considered, so I will wait for a bit further discussion on Part 1 now that I\u0027ve outlined my reasoning :)",
