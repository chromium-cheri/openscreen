      "message": "We have 2 separate ctors. The first (line 56) allows only one endpoint, and this ctor requires both\n\nPrior to the recent change, IPEndpoints always were considered to \u0027exist\u0027 - so making either of these endpoints optional would have been absl::optional\u003cIPEndpoint\u003e. We\u0027d discussed this as part of the orignal design, and decided against it, so I am continuing to require both be valid in this ctor to stick with our previous design decisions\n\nIf you disagree, let me know and I will create a follow-up CL",
