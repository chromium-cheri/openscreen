My reasoning behind this is that credentials is not something solely owned by TlsConnectionFactoryPosix. The caller trusts SetListenCredentials with a const object and SetListenCredentials violates that trust.\n\nAlso, I couldn\u0027t find usages of SetListenCredentials anywhere in this CL or tests.",
