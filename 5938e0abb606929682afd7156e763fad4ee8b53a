      "message": "Aside: \n\nI wonder how this is used in practice since different codecs have different formulas/numbers of reference frames.  For example, the VP9 encoder maintains a pool of 8 candidate reference frames and picks up to 3 when coding an inter frame.\n\nhttps://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t\u003d168947\n\nAVC also can generate B-frames (two reference frames, one in the past and one in the future).\n\nAnyway in OSP we have each frame provide a list of reference frame IDs so the agent knows when it\u0027s safe to submit a frame to the decoder.",
