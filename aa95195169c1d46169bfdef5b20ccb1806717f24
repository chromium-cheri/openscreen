      "message": "In practice, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s that helpful. It would let us log \"these 3 errors occurred\" instead of \"this error occurred\" (which Trace Logging already gives us), but from an embedder perspective there isn\u0027t much more they can do\n\nNot against the idea though - a general `AggregateException : public Exception` is pretty standard for most error handling schemes\n\nWDYT?",
