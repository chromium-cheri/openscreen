Do you have an idea of how this will embed yet into Chromium?\n\nLooking at the current state of //components/cast_streaming and //media/remoting with Ryan will give you a roadmap of the integration points to manage the session, but still need to figure out the glue code to initialize and switch between renderers.",

      "message": "Maybe we should move the supporting classes like these out of standalone_receiver and into its own cast/receiver/service folder, if these objects were useful for running a receiver in-process in an embedder (versus running as a standalone application).\n\nI\u0027m thinking about Ryan\u0027s need to do some end to end testing of the streaming receiver in the Web runtime.\n\nNot sure as it look like we would need to enable more config variables like the TCP port number.  Probably best to do as a separate patch/project after talking to Ryan.",
