If there is a better reviewer, feel free to remove yourself from the reviewer list.\n\nThis change _looks_ pretty big, but most of the changed lines are due to indentation changes. If you disable whitespace differences, the changes are more clear.",

      "message": "This CL exposes a lot of internal code in the library to Chromium builds which will make it significantly harder to maintain.  I would like to see if there is a way we could provide something upstream that meets your needs without exposing a lot of internal library source to Chromium.\n\nWould like to hear Jordan\u0027s thoughts as well.",
