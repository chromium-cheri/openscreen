      "message": "These are things needed by url_parse.cc.  In Chromium they are actually under //url.  I was going to put them under //util, where the future URL class would go, but that would lead to a circular dependency.  Chromium gets around this by putting the third_party/mozilla files directly in the //url/BUILD.gn source set.  Doing that here would also allow the assert()s to be OSP_DCHECK()s.  WDYT about these options?",
