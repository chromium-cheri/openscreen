      "message": "There were quite a lot of things wrong with this one canon_enclen is not always filled in, private (that you all access it prevents us from fixing a deep thread-safety issue in this library), and most importantly, isn\u0027t even the right length.\n\nX509_NAME_get_text_by_NID returns the length when you pass in NULL. Unfortunately, it\u0027s confusing and you need to allocate one more than advertised, due to a trailing NUL.\n\nFinally, the error-handling was wrong. X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID returns -1, not zero, when there is no common name. You all probably should add a test here, and a fuzzer.",
