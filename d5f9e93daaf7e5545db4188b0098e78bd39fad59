      "message": "It seems like this is to resolve linking issues you get by literally adding the \"openscreen_unittests\" exe as a dep.  IMHO this is the wrong way to worry about linking.  Maybe openscreen_unittests can be refactored to a separate source_set() and executable() so chromium can depend on the source_set() and provide its own linking deps there.",
