      "message": "Handling this is definitely a weird situation but there\u0027s currently a problem for (has_changed \u0026\u0026 !types.IsEmpty()).  If has_changed is true, it could be because one of the merged NSEC records had a record type that was removed.  Then we reassign |nsec| as this \"union minus conflicts\" record, which fails to actually remove the type from its source NSEC record.  For that matter, (has_changed \u0026\u0026 types.IsEmpty()) should also remove any merged NSEC records.\n\nMy thoughts are:\n 1. Still do the union, but also take the min ttl.  If we have to overwrite |nsec|, use the min ttl and remove the others that were merged.\n 2. Process them separately.  This has the disadvantage that it\u0027s a little awkward to skip the other NSEC records then reset |it| if there were skipped NSEC records, plus it\u0027s extra iteration.\n\nOf those, my preference is 1.",
