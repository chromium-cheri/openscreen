      "message": "After looking at how the demo apps use NetworkReader, I think I misunderstood the start-up path for UDP socket reads. I\u0027ve removed these, and fixed other parts of this change to match my new understanding. :)\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong: IIUC, NetworkReader is only needed to \"pump\" the socket reads and is only meant to be used in standalone apps. For a Chromium embedder, UdpSocket::Client::OnRead() would be called (from Chromium \"platform glue\") any time after the client has called UdpSocket::Bind(). In other words, for Chromium, there is no separate thing like a NetworkReader+thread to have to instantiate for packets to get received and passed to the Client.",
