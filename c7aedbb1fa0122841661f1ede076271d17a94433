      "message": "Good question. I was going to go through later and refine this object for various services.  Here\u0027s what I think we need:\n\nmDNS screen listener:\n- port (or always 5353?)\n- interface list\n\nmDNS screen publisher:\n- port (always 5353?)\n- interface list\n- server endpoint(s)\n- service specific data (service name, txt, etc.)\n\nquic connection client:\n- interface list (or will the screen listener will return the interface a receiver is discovered on?\n\nquic connection server:\n- interface list\n- server endpoint(s)\n\nSo for the client, it looks like we need an interface list, and for the server, we need that plus the server endpoints (IPv6 and IPv6 per interface).\n\nWe could have a single object that is a list of interfaces, with an optional list of endpoints per interface.  The endpoints are either populated by the embedder, or filled in by the library if a connection server is started on an interface without endpoints.\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "I know we are passing an interface list to the mDNS screen publisher to allow avoiding multicast on certain interfaces, but I don\u0027t see such an automatic reason to do the same thing for QUIC.  ScreenInfo _does_ contain the interface on which it was discovered, but I would expect normal IP routing to be sufficient for connecting via QUIC.  So I don\u0027t see a need for an interface list on either side of QUIC.  Even if we do, I don\u0027t think the types should be shared in this situation.",
