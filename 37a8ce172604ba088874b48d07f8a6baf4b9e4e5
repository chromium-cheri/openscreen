      "message": "Since we are using |receiver_id| throughout all of the APIs that need to track individual Cast receivers, maybe it would be worth adding a receiver_id field that stores the UUID in the right format already (lowercase without hyphens).  In that change, we would deprecate the unique_id field.\n\nThat way the client could pass the receiver_id into all of the APIs that expect it and know it matches the ID that was found through DNS-SD.\n\nFine to do in a later change though.
