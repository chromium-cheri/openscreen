Right now, you would have to select these lines and uncomment them in order for this to be runnable in a terminal. Alternatively, maybe we should include a bash script?\n\nUpdate: I checked, I\u0027m pretty sure there is no way to to make a multiline comment in GNI files easily, so we would probably have to stick it all on one line for this to work.",
