      "message": "According to the quic spec[1] a client has to open with a unpredictable Destination Connection ID as long as it didn\u0027t receive one from the server. Once the server replies with its zero-length connection ID the client takes this over. I validated that this works with Wireshark. The resulting behavior still seems compliant with the zero-lenght Connection ID requirement mentioned in the OSP spec.\n\nThis is another compatibility fix with quic-go as it strictly enforced this rule. I opened a ticket on the OSP spec repo[2] to consider highlighting behavior this in the spec as it\u0027s a bit quirky. I also opened a ticket on the quiche repo[3] to consider documenting or enforcing this behavior.\n\n[2] https://github.com/w3c/openscreenprotocol/issues/331\n[3] https://github.com/google/quiche/issues/70",
