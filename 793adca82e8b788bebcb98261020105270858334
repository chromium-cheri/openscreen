      "message": "Can we expose a list of known codecs that the Decoder should know, so that this can be strongly typed? If the user passes a value like \"h 264\" instead of \"H264\", we should probably know ASAP and not call down through multiple layers?\n\nI know it\u0027s a suggestion here (we try other codecs), but that seems cleaner to me.",
