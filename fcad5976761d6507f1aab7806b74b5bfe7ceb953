See https://autoroll.skia.org/r/openscreen-chromium/roll-history.\n\nThis should fix an issue with the `ios-simulator` Chrome build. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t find a good way to test this without having access to a MacOS device to build with.\n\nThe other issue should be resolved (temporarily) by a revert that I landed.",
