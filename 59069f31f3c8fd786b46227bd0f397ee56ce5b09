It looks like when the EnumTable template is being instantiated, it can\u0027t resolve the names I\u0027m adding to the openscreen::string_util namespace.\n\nHowever, compilation another string_util usage in a template in mdns_records.h works fine.\n\nJordan, I think you updated the repo to use nested namespaces, did you run anything like this? Any ideas?",
