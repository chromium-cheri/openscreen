      "message": "The way ipcz does this is to define a GN variable in build_overrides with the include location:\n\nthird_party/ipcz/build_overrides/ipcz.gni\n\nand\n\nbuild_overrides/ipcz.gni\n\nThen it defines a config that is consumed locally to add that include dir:\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/ipcz/src/BUILD.gn;drc\u003de93e66a67ac7f1030fbd381e3109bac96bc70458;l\u003d320\n\nI think the difference is that there are some targets in Chromium that also need this config.  Maybe we could split he config from the include dir location in a future cleanup.  I also would rather Chromium not set include dirs this way, so that could be another way to improve this in the future.",
