      "message": "I would slightly prefer these to accept a std::chrono::seconds value, since you can convert the DateTime returned by the getters to std::chrono::seconds.  Also we generally prefer using the std::chrono types in the library.\n\nHowever don\u0027t feel strongly since that change requires more annoying conversions (via std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t, or something like it), and it sounds like you just want to plug in a floating value from the fuzz test generator.  If it\u0027s left as time_t, maybe note that the reason is for for fuzz testing.\n\nEither way, can you please document the meaning of the argument, i.e. // Seconds since the epoch.",
