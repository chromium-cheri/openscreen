      "message": "Just curious, what\u0027s the reason to move these here instead of a build file?  Does the Apple linker not support this and/or this isn\u0027t desired on Mac?  I noticed the Mac toolchain used different flags, but why is rpath not used?  Would using an `if (is_gcc)` block be equivalent but maybe less clean?",

There _probably_ wouldn\u0027t be any ABI problem with compiling our code as c++11 and only third_party/chromium_quic as c++14 but I hadn\u0027t looked at that yet.  Do you know of any problems with doing that?",
