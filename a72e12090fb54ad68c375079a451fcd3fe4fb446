      "message": "I considered moving this to a class, but the 2 methods we use to create them are in conversion_layer.cc:\nDnsQueryInfo GetInstanceQueryInfo(const InstanceKey\u0026 key);\nDnsQueryInfo GetPtrQueryInfo(const ServiceKey\u0026 key);\n\nNeither of these really makes sense (at least IMHO) as a ctor, so there didn\u0027t seem to be any benefit to making it a class. They could work as static factory methods, but that\u0027s really no different from the current approach\n\nWhat do you think? If you prefer that approach, I can create another follow-up CL (after this one) to accomplish that change",
