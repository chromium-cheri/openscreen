      "message": "Not that clever but still would reduce duplication which would help future additions/changes: like protobuf, put the sources (and possibly deps) into a global list, then create two source_sets using that list but with different configs/defines/etc., then standalone_receiver as-is becomes a group that picks between standalone_receiver_dummy and standalone_receiver_sdl.  Finally, e2e_tests can explicitly depend on standalone_receiver_dummy.",

      "message": "Didn\u0027t realize that you can have global lists outside of a source_set in GN, I definitely like this look a lot better. Since we have to recompile with different values of CAST_STANDALONE_RECEIVER_HAVE_EXTERNAL_LIBS, I think that this is the minimal amount of duplication possible in the build file, the only duplicate line is the receiver:channel dependency in e2e_tests and cast_receiver.",
