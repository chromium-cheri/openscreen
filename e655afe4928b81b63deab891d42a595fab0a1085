      "message": "Not that clever but still would reduce duplication which would help future additions/changes: like protobuf, put the sources (and possibly deps) into a global list, then create two source_sets using that list but with different configs/defines/etc., then standalone_receiver as-is becomes a group that picks between standalone_receiver_dummy and standalone_receiver_sdl.  Finally, e2e_tests can explicitly depend on standalone_receiver_dummy.",
