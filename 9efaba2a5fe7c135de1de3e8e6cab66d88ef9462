      "message": "Hi, mark.\n\nThe last update for osp_messages.cddl was in April 2019, so it hasn\u0027t been updated for a long time. I have two questions here:\n1. Should we change the implementation definition to be completely consistent with the spec definition? Here I make this change for Presentation Protocol.\n2. Should we also move the spec definition to implementation definition for Remote Playback Protocol and Streaming Protocol? They are not used currently.",
