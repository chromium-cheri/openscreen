      "message": "This was one way to fix the issue I was seeing with the SocketHandleWaiter not executing on the handles.\n\nTurns out, you are completely right that this isn\u0027t necessary. I just needed to change my boundary checks from:\n\nhandle already updated (start time, infinity)\nprocess handles [0, timeout)\nto:\nhandle already updated [start time, infinity)\nprocess handles [0, timeout]\n\nBasically just including the start time and the timeout when appropriate, so in cases where we have a fake clock the zero case works properly.\n\nThis actually fixes a very unlikely potential bug, I think this is better with fake clock.",
