I\u0027m planning a followup patch to integrate this into messaging but need to work out some kinks with Chromium and building inside/outside of it.\n\nI also have a design doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gAGjCAU2sCdH_wr3CFCymAb5WBRSDwshpfV4G73SYqg/edit#heading\u003dh.fuj9rergqgk1) and am actively working to get valijson into Chromium third_party.\n\nFrom what I have seen so far, this would be a great way to get detailed error messages without writing a lot of boilerplate, as well as improve documentation (the JSON schema can be the living document, and ALSO be used to check actual messages in the wild).\n\n",
