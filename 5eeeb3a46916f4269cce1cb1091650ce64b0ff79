      "message": "PTAL, thanks!  The non-trivial parts are moving request_response_handler.h and message_demuxer.cc, the latter is to break the public-\u003eimpl-\u003epublic dependency cycle.  ATM I don\u0027t think MessageDemuxer should be an interface and move completely to impl/, so this seemed like the best compromise, but LMK.",

I didn\u0027t look at the entire files, so check that you aren\u0027t propagating any public_configs that will do something unexpected.\n\nOur GN files could use some more refactoring to better define public/private targets but that is for another day.\n",
