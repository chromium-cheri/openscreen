      "message": "In the OSP implementation, QuerierImpl always calls this callback from the TaskRunner thread - the callback gets called as part of MdnsQuerier\u0027s callback, which is always done on the TaskRunner. This is not currently enforced on the DNS-SD layer, but I am planning to do this work if we eventually want to allow the embedder to override just our mDNS implementation while using our DNS-SD impl. Adding a TODO to be sure this isn\u0027t missed\n\nSome external DNS-SD implementations might use a multithreaded approach for DNS-SD (ie Apple\u0027s Bonjour takes a callback that is called asynchronously) so I added this as a requirement. While the TaskRunner is not provided here, the embedder-overridable factory method (see here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/openscreen/+/1913977) does provide a task runner",
