      "message": "I feel this #define situation would be a lot simpler if trace_logging_unittest.cc could just define its own IsTraceLoggingEnabled instead of getting around it with macros here.  This may have been discussed before but I feel it\u0027s worth reconsidering since this change would make the situation more complicated.",

      "message": "The reason this isn\u0027t currently supported is because calling a static method for IsLoggingEnabled(...) is faster than calling an instance level method of the platform. If we updated IsLoggingEnabled to be a platform method, this problem would be solved, but there would also be a perf cost.\n\nI am all for changing to a platform instance call though - I actually think that API would make more sense. What do you both think?",

      "message": "Well, my suggestion was to literally put `void IsTraceLoggingEnabled(TraceCategory::Value) { return true; }` in trace_logging_unittest.cc because nothing else in that exe defines/needs it, not necessarily to move it to the platform interface (i.e. make it virtual).  IMHO it\u0027s at least as valid as the macro solution, but I don\u0027t feel that strongly after thinking about it some more.  I\u0027ll leave it up to you.",
