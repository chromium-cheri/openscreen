      "message": "A network interface bound on v4 and v6 will never send queries on v6?\n\nThis is probably a reasonable default behavior.  It would be surprising if the set of nodes reachable by multicast over v4 was different from the set reachable over v6.\n\nCreating 2 sockets would just double the network traffic in most cases.\n\nEventually, we may want to give clients the choice to prefer using v4 or v6.",
