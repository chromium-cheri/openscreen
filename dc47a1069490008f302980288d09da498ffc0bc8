I find this will fail when I am building and running osp_demo, which does not fail before.\n\nI checked the code and can not find where the discovery related tasks are posted to the `task_runner_`. So it seems all discovery related tasks run on the main thread instead of the thread where the `task_runner_` is, causing the failure. Have we made any changes to the logic of task post?",
