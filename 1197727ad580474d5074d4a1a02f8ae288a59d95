      "message": "When we discussed this the other day, we planned to support Write Callbacks so that Quic could be notified when the socket was ready for further writes to occur. My understanding was that this method would serve that purpose - it wouldn\u0027t do actual writing, but would only be used to signal when the Select(...) call determined that the socket was free to write to again\n\nthoughts?",

I just don\u0027t know what it will end up looking like and we\u0027ll probably learn more as you go to use the NetworkRunner in all the places we outlined.  I don\u0027t think we need to block landing this CL on knowing what that interface should look like.  We can land this CL, use it in QUIC, find out what is lacking, and add to this interface later once we know more.",
