      "message": "I see some pros to splitting this type up, but it adds complexity, and you wont be able to add addresses to an existing instance record without making a copy.  At first glance, this doesn\u0027t feel like an \"is-a\" relationship.\n\nWhat about just making the addresses optional in DnsSdInstanceRecord?\n\nWill instance records without IP addresses ever be exposed to the DNS-SD layer?  ISTM that as soon as the DNS records are received from an interface, the mDNS layer can pass the IP addresss of that interface up to the DNS-SD layer.",
