      "message": "I\u0027ve seen two different behaviors of markdown in various .md viewers. One treats linebreaks as new lines and one doesnt.

IMHO, if we can\u0027t say which, we should use the more restrictive approach. I\u0027ve updated the CL per your request, but can revert it if needed. WDYT?",
