For example, readers will see #include \"valijson/foo.hpp\" and not know that valijson is in third_party.\n\nThis is required by the Google style guide:\n\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Names_and_Order_of_Includes\n\nFor well-known libraries like abseil or gtest/gmock, exceptions seem okay.",
