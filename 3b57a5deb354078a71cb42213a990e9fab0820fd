      "message": "You mentioned on the other patch\n\n\u003e The default when exporting code from an internal repo is to scrub all the metadata including CL authors and descriptions. There is a way to customize those rules so that some data can flow through with markup, but I didn\u0027t see a strong need to institute that practice right now.\n\nCan we instead change the default to a different constant string? I think \"Update Cast Core Protos\" or similar would make a lot more sense during code review and in the git history than \"Internal Change\"\n\nIf it\u0027s nontrivial to change, this is good enough. Just a preference",
