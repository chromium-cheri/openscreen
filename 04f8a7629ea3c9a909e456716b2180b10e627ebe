      "message": "In Chrome, this ends up being handled somewhere around the MediaStream initialization. I have some additional work here to figure out what the flow will be for embedders--it\u0027s less obvious than what we have so far.\n\nI figured this would be a good cut point for this patch, and I\u0027ll keep sorting out the embedder flow and hopefully finish up over the next week or so.",

See https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/remoting/end2end_test_renderer.cc as an example and check the Chrome remoting design doc.\n\nFeel free to loop in Ryan as he\u0027s looking at supporting the remoting receiver in Chromium as well.",
