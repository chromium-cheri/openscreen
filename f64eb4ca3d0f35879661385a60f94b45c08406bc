      "message": "Should we be making this change everywhere?\n\nFor instance, doing it in CodecToString() above is fine, because it would be a logic flaw in our code to provide an invalid enum value. Thus, there must always be a valid string result returned there.\n\nHowever, here, IIUC, this is for the \"parse a string that came from somewhere external to this program\" case. In this case, whatever generated the string could be buggy, but it\u0027s not a bug in our code. It\u0027s an untrusted input where we should probably bubble-up an error, or at least return a result that means \"unknown\" or \"invalid\" for bad string inputs.\n\nIn other words, I think the original code shouldn\u0027t have used OSP_DCHECK() here either: We don\u0027t want to allow bad external inputs to crash the program.",
