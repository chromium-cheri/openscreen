      "message": "There is a bug somewhere which causes when binding to the mDNS IPv6 address:\n\n\u003e SocketBindFailure \u003d \"endpoint: [ff02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:00fb]:5353, error: Invalid argument\"\n\nThis IP and endpoint are called out by RFC 6762, so we have to use it. But when binding, to loopback or to other interfaces I tested with, this issue is consistently hit. I\u0027ve dug through our platform code, and it seems to be on the posix bind() call, but I can\u0027t find what\u0027s causing it since all the code around it seems to be correct (and the IPv4 code works)\n\nFor now, I filed a bug (crbug.com/openscreen/116)",
