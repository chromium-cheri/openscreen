# Entire Flow Chart

The following entire flow chart is a copy from [Open Screen Spec](https://w3c.github.io/openscreenprotocol/).
It shows the entire process when agents have not authenticated each other,
including discovery, QUIC connection establishment, metadata exchange and
authentication.

*IMPORTANT:* This implementation is not yet up-to-date with the current draft
specification or feature-complete. So some steps in the chart are missing in 
current implementation.
