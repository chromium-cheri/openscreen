Simpler! :)",

Then, task_runner_ would just be a pointer to the internal or external one, depending on which ctor was used.\n\nThe reason for merging this all into the same class is that we have an \"either-or\" situation: We don\u0027t want an extra thread and task runner spawned if it isn\u0027t going to be used. It\u0027s best for the \"either-or\" decision to be encapsulated in the same place, rather than across files.\n\nAlso, ~PlatformClientPosix() would have to check if the thread is running before trying to join on it:\n\n  if (task_runner_thread_.joinable()) {\n    task_runner_thread_.join();\n  }",
