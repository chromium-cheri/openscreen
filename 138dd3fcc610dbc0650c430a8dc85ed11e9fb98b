      "message": "Hi Mark. This is something like a reland of https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/openscreen/+/5369648\n\nFrom reviewing the Chrome uprev failures of openscreen, it looked like there were issues with Windows, Fuchsia, and Android builds. I was able to verify that the Android `cast_receiver` target builds with this change. For Windows, Fuchsia, and IOS, this disables the `cast_receiver` target. Fuchsia and IOS are not posix, so they are missing parts of the network standalone implementation.",
