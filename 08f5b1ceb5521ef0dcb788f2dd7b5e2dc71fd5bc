      "message": "This cheats a bit by only allowing a span over read-only data, so we don\u0027t need to make a template.\n\nIf we need both read-only and read-write spans, I will need to update it to be a template.  Not a big deal, but makes it more verbose.  I took a look at the other patch, and it looks like we might need both for EncodedFrame.",
