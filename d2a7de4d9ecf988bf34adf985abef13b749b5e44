      "message": "If the same answer is sent multiple times, it\u0027s possible that it would get inserted here multiple times. That shouldn\u0027t affect the results though - and given how small the known_answers_ list is expected to be, using a vector with duplicated should still be faster than using a set to dedup them\n\nWDYT?",

Plus a future limitation on the number of truncated queries doesn\u0027t really help with the size of the single query.\nI would prefer deduping here as a more correct way, but a hard limit on number of entries would work as well (i.e. stop adding them after a certain number has been accumulated).\nDuplicates might happen even with a valid client due packet loss in conjunction with how queries are resent after 1, 2, 4, 8 etc. seconds.",
