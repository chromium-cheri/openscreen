I am trying to re-enable osp_demo in this CL (still WIP, will ask you to review when almost done): https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/openscreen/+/4880923.\nIt is found that most features needed by QUICHE from abseil-cpp are not enabled in OpenScreen now. So I submitted this CL to enable them. PATL, thanks.",

      "message": "In general we are trying to minimize usage of abseil in the core open screen library; this is because on platforms like Android, it is difficult or impossible for them to ship abseil as a shared library.\n\nI think it\u0027s fine to add abseil dependencies for use in the osp_demo, but for this file, can you move all of these additional sources to their own source_set, like \"abseil_quiche\", and set the GN visibility of that source_set to only be visible to the quiche code that needs it?",
