I am trying to re-enable osp_demo in this CL (still WIP, will ask you to review when almost done): https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/openscreen/+/4880923.\nIt is found that most features needed by QUICHE from abseil-cpp are not enabled in OpenScreen now. So I submitted this CL to enable them. PATL, thanks.",

      "message": "I add the `executable(\"osp_demo\")` in the linked CL and add these additional files one by one when there are link errors when building. I think these files are needed both by quiche core implementation and quiche default platform implementation.\n\nIf I understand correctly, we enable building QUICHE as a source set in the previous CL. However, no executable target depends on it. So we don\u0027t meet link error there.",
