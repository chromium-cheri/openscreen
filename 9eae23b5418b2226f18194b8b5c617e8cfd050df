      "message": "It\u0027s possible that *our* JsonCpp is built with int64 support, but Chromium\u0027s is not. See: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:third_party/jsoncpp/source/include/json/value.h;l\u003d301?originalUrl\u003dhttps:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F\n\nFiled bug for follow-up: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/openscreen/issues/detail?id\u003d99\n\n\u003e Could this also be an issue for rtp_payload_type or ssrc?\n\nrtp_payload_type is fine, since that comes from an int enum. I just realized ssrc could be a problem because it is an unsigned 32-bit int, so the static_cast\u003c\u003e could be messing up values larger than 2^31-1. I\u0027ve fixed that.\n\n\u003e We might want a utility class for safe numeric conversions (similar to safe_conversions.h in //base).\n\nWe have util/saturate_cast.h. But, that\u0027s not checked conversions. It\u0027s just clamp-to-valid-range conversions.",
