The only place where you insert into sockets_to_unwatch_ is there, and there is no way you\u0027ll fire a callback for a cancelled socket since it is removed before the call to AwaitSocketsReadable.",

      "message": "You\u0027re right, this doesn\u0027t actually fix the issues I was worried about. Took another look and have changed the code back to how it was previously, where the read_callbacks_ entry is removed in CancelRead\n\nI\u0027ve updated with a condition-variable approach as discussed offline. Let me know if this seems to solve the issue better, at least for the short term until sockets can be reworked in a separate change",
